So to start i have taken this offline because it was just a experiment 
it was going to do many diffrent things but then it became a bot that would post popular tumblr posts 
If you would like to see the bot here it is https://www.tumblr.com/affinityrae-coding
I am going to see what else i can do with the tumblr api 
So for now this is offline until i read more into all this stuff
I might make a bot that learns from tumblr posts and then forms oppinions and stuff like that idk
But for now goodbye
